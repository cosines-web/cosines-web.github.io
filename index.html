				The 21st century data revolution provides exciting opportunities for enhancing understanding of the world in virtually every area of human activity. However the process of moving from data to scientific understanding is often challenging. Statistical science provides a principled framework for this process which should be contrasted with that of pure prediction central to numerous machine learning procedures. However, as the size and complexity of modern data sets continues to increase, and the ambition of the understanding sought from the data also expands, fresh challenges emerge to the implementation of formal statistical approaches. While 20th century computational statistical methodologies (often based around Markov chain and Sequential Monte Carlo methods and their variants) have brought complex problems within the grasp of classical and Bayesian model-based paradigms, todayâ€™s complex problems pose immense challenges for principled statistical methods. Our vision is to bridge the gap between Statistical Science and the most challenging inferential problems posed by Data Science.

				While we will create generic methodology having widespread application in many areas, we will take motivation and place major emphases on the important emerging areas of <em>Data-centric Engineering</em> and <em>Defence & Security</em>. We will foster a research collaboration with strong synergies between on the one hand, statistical theory, algorithms and methodology; and on the other hand substantive problems of great societal interest within engineering and security.
				The problems that CoSInES will tackle will be characterised by complex large data sets indexed in space and often continuously in time. New models will require not only spatial components, but also large network and time-series structure often requiring the solutions to (stochastic) differential equations. Inference will require a completely new generation of algorithms likely to require complicated Monte Carlo and deterministic approaches. Algorithms will need to be tailored for particular computer architecture, and will require underpinning theory to show they scale. New theory on computational and statistical robustness of approaches developed will be required to ensure the usefulness of the procedures developed.

				<h3>Data Centric Engineering</h3>
				<p>
					Across every sector of the engineering professions and the disciplines that underpin them there is a realisation
					of the increasing value of all forms of data and the central role it now plays in all of the design, manufacture,
					construction, commissioning, operation, maintenance and decommissioning of complex engineering systems and
					projects e.g. 
					<a href="http://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/reports/connecting-data-driving-productivity">
						the recent Royal Academy of Engineering and Institution of Engineering and Technology report
					</a> 
					on
					driving productivity and innovation by connecting data. The Royal Society, along with the British Academy,
					also published a 
					<a href="https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/data-governance/"> 
						report on Data Management and Use
					</a> 
					with a specific case study on Smart Metering in the power
					supply industry provided. This is largely driven by the confluence of emerging technologies enabling measurement
					as never before considered feasible levels of precision, range, coverage, and volume of data become available. As
					such the statistical sciences are the essential collaborative driver for this disruptive change in engineering driven by
					data, and this programme is set to deliver essential advances to realise this potential.

				<h3>Defense and Security</h3>
				<p>
					As individuals generate more data and devise new ways to interact, propagate, receive, and relate to one another, in
					an increasingly digital world, the security authorities face a set of dynamic and challenging tasks in keeping the UK
					secure. The data that people individually and collectively produce could potentially be used to understand a great
					deal about them. There is a need to understand what this data can, and cannot, reliably tell us for understanding
					and optimising security strategies, allowing a deep understanding of an individual and groupâ€™s intent, whilst simultaneously 
					respecting citizensâ€™ privacy. With respect to this latter point, the development of inference procedures
					that are privacy preserving is crucial as regulation evolves. For these reason, the development of new mathematical
					and statistical techniques that offer improved statistical insight is crucial to achieve total security in the UK.
