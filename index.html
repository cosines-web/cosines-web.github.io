				The CoSInES project will bring together a world class team of researchers from Universities of Warwick, Bristol, Lancaster, Oxford and the Alan Turing Institute to tackle fundamental challenges in Computational Statistics and key applications from Engineering and Security. The project will run from 1st October 2018 till 30th September 2023.

				The 21st century data revolution provides exciting opportunities for enhancing understanding of the world in virtually every area of human activity. However the process of moving from data to scientific understanding is often challenging. Statistical science provides a principled framework for this process which should be contrasted with that of pure prediction central to numerous machine learning procedures. However, as the size and complexity of modern data sets continues to increase, and the ambition of the understanding sought from the data also expands, fresh challenges emerge to the implementation of formal statistical approaches. While 20th century computational statistical methodologies (often based around Markov chain and Sequential Monte Carlo methods and their variants) have brought complex problems within the grasp of classical and Bayesian model-based paradigms, todayâ€™s complex problems pose immense challenges for principled statistical methods. Our vision is to bridge the gap between Statistical Science and the most challenging inferential problems posed by Data Science.

				While we will create generic methodology having widespread application in many areas, we will take motivation and place major emphases on the important emerging areas of <em>Data-centric Engineering</em> and <em>Defence & Security</em>. We will foster a research collaboration with strong synergies between on the one hand, statistical theory, algorithms and methodology; and on the other hand substantive problems of great societal interest within engineering and security.
				The problems that CoSInES will tackle will be characterised by complex large data sets indexed in space and often continuously in time. New models will require not only spatial components, but also large network and time-series structure often requiring the solutions to (stochastic) differential equations. Inference will require a completely new generation of algorithms likely to require complicated Monte Carlo and deterministic approaches. Algorithms will need to be tailored for particular computer architecture, and will require underpinning theory to show they scale. New theory on computational and statistical robustness of approaches developed will be required to ensure the usefulness of the procedures developed.
