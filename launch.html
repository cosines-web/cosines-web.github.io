				On November 2nd 2018, the CoSInES project will be launched with an afternoon of presentations related to the project.
			</p>
			<p>
				Weâ€™d like to invite anyone who would like to attend to register their interest by emailing <a href="mailto:S.Desai.3@warwick.ac.uk">Shital Desai</a>. 
				Lunch will be provided starting from 12:15pm and the event will conclude with a short drinks reception to celebrate the beginning of the project. 
				The talks are scheduled to finish by roughly 16.30 and will take place in <a href="http://campus-cms.warwick.ac.uk/share/091ad5a583e3c8151640ce00f3a73371">Warwick University Oculus lecture theatre OC0.02</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The project will very soon be advertising 5 4-year PDRA positions associated with the project. These positions can be based at any of the 5 institutions involved in the grant. Informal enquiries regarding these positions to <a href="mailto:gareth.o.roberts@warwick.ac.uk">Gareth Roberts</a> are very welcome.
