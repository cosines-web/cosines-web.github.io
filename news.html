			<h3>Reversible Jump PDMP Samplers for Variable Selection</h3>
			<em>27 October 2020</em>
			<p>
			  Augustin Chevallier, Paul Farnhead and Matthew Sutton
			  have recently published on Arxiv, their paper
			  entitled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11771"><i>Reversible
			      Jump PDMP Samplers for Variable Selection</i></a>.

			  This paper looks at how to extend recent PDMP samplers
			  to model choice problems, and in particular variable
			  selection. It gives a general recipe for adding
			  appropriate reversible jump moves which allow
			  exploration of different models by adding or removing
			  variables from the model.

			<h3>BayesComp 2020</h3>
			<em>24 January 2020</em>
			<p>
				From 7-10 January 2020 the biannual ISBA meeting on Bayesian Computation (BayesComp) was held at the University of Florida, Gainsville, organised by Jim Hobert and colleagues. The meeting was particularly well-attended by members of the CoSInES project. A list of CoSInES-affiliated attendees includes: PIs Prof. Gareth Roberts, Prof. Christophe Andrieu, Prof. Paul Fearnhead and Dr. Anthony Lee who all gave talks, and research associates Dr. Augustin Chevalier, Dr. Lionel Riou-Durand and Dr. Andi Wang who all presented posters.

				Overarching scientific themes from the meeting included the analysis of computational Bayesian methods in high-dimensional settings, study of nonreversible sampling methods and the study of robustness and approximate methods. A notable presentation was the opening plenary talk, given by CoSInES PI Prof. Paul Fearnhead on ‘Continuous-time MCMC’, focusing on the Zig-Zag Sampler and related developments.

				The location was particularly pleasant; the days were sunny and relatively warm (despite being winter in Florida), and the meeting was held in the beautiful University of Florida campus, with a large lake (home to alligators, though none were spotted) and within easy walking distance of the lively Gainesville town centre.
