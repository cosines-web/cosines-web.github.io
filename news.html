			<h4><b>CoSInES-Bayes4Health Masterclass</b></h4>
			<em>22 November 2022</em>
			<p>
				TThe CoSInES-Bayes4Health Masterclass on Variational Inference was hosted at the MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge, from the 7th to the 10th of November, 2022. This event was the second in the series, after the successful Masterclass on Sequential Monte Carlo in March-April 2022, and continued in the spirit of sharing knowledge and encouraging collaboration between early-career researchers affiliated with the grants.

This workshop expanded slightly from the previous Masterclass in terms of both length (4 days) and attendance (30 attendees, with some of them attending online). Additionally, due to the main topic of the workshop, many of the lectures were delivered by early-career researchers from outside of the grant, spanning groups in Cambridge, UCL, Oxford, and the CNRS in Paris.

The organisation of the event was again led by Filippo Pagani, assisted closely by Francesca Crucinio, Andi Wang and Sam Power. Local organisation was aided by Alison Quenault and Sharon Dippenaar. The high-level research programme for the workshop was developed collaboratively by Sanmitra Ghosh, Hélène Ruffieux, and Deniz Akyildiz. The lectures themselves were planned and delivered by Hélène Ruffieux, Camilla Lingjaerde, Sanmitra Ghosh, Tui Nolan (all Cambridge), Kamélia Daudel (Oxford), and Badr-Eddine Chérief-Abdellatif (CNRS). Additionally, more advanced research-level seminars were presented by Jeremias Knoblauch (UCL) and Rob Cornish (Oxford).

The event was again well-received by the audience, who praised the high quality and interactivity of the tutorial presentations, as well as the freedom provided by the schedule for interaction between attendees outside of lectures. Planning for the next instalment of the Masterclass series is already underway, and is eagerly anticipated by many.

			<h4><b>CoSInES-Bayes4Health Masterclass</b></h4>
			<em>22 April 2022</em>
			<p>
				The CoSInES-Bayes4Health Masterclass on Sequential Monte Carlo was hosted at the University of Bristol from the 30th of March to the 1st of April, 2022. The idea was proposed in October 2021, in the aftermath of the Warwick Methodology Week, as an initiative to share knowledge and encourage collaboration among the members of the grants, with a particular focus on postdocs.
The 3-day long event featured introductory sessions on Sequential Monte Carlo and related topics by Deniz Akyildiz, Alice Corbella, Francesca Crucinio, Sam Power, and Lorenzo Rimella and more advanced lectures on research topics in the area, given by the PIs Christophe Andrieu, Adam Johansen, and Anthony Lee.

			<h4><b>Statistical Finite elements for misspecified models</b></h4>
			<em>8 January 2021</em>
			<p>

			  Connor Duffin, Edward Cripps, Thomas Stemler and Mark
			  Girolami have recently published in PNAS, their paper
			  entitled <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/2/e2015006118"><i>Statistical
			  finite elements for misspecified models</i></a>.

			  Science and engineering have benefited greatly from
			  the ability of finite element methods (FEMs) to
			  simulate nonlinear, time-dependent complex
			  systems. The recent advent of extensive data
			  collection from such complex systems now raises the
			  question of how to systematically incorporate these
			  data into finite element models, consistently updating
			  the solution in the face of mathematical model
			  misspecification with physical reality. This article
			  describes general and widely applicable methodology
			  for the coherent synthesis of data with FEM models,
			  providing a data-driven probability distribution that
			  captures all sources of uncertainty in the pairing of
			  FEM with measurements.

			<h4><b>Reversible Jump PDMP Samplers for Variable Selection</b></h4>
			<em>27 October 2020</em>
			<p>
			  Augustin Chevallier, Paul Farnhead and Matthew Sutton
			  have recently published on Arxiv, their paper
			  entitled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11771"><i>Reversible
			      Jump PDMP Samplers for Variable Selection</i></a>.

			  This paper looks at how to extend recent PDMP samplers
			  to model choice problems, and in particular variable
			  selection. It gives a general recipe for adding
			  appropriate reversible jump moves which allow
			  exploration of different models by adding or removing
			  variables from the model.

			<h4><b>BayesComp 2020</b></h4>
			<em>24 January 2020</em>
			<p>
				From 7-10 January 2020 the biannual ISBA meeting on Bayesian Computation (BayesComp) was held at the University of Florida, Gainsville, organised by Jim Hobert and colleagues. The meeting was particularly well-attended by members of the CoSInES project. A list of CoSInES-affiliated attendees includes: PIs Prof. Gareth Roberts, Prof. Christophe Andrieu, Prof. Paul Fearnhead and Dr. Anthony Lee who all gave talks, and research associates Dr. Augustin Chevalier, Dr. Lionel Riou-Durand and Dr. Andi Wang who all presented posters.

				Overarching scientific themes from the meeting included the analysis of computational Bayesian methods in high-dimensional settings, study of nonreversible sampling methods and the study of robustness and approximate methods. A notable presentation was the opening plenary talk, given by CoSInES PI Prof. Paul Fearnhead on ‘Continuous-time MCMC’, focusing on the Zig-Zag Sampler and related developments.

				The location was particularly pleasant; the days were sunny and relatively warm (despite being winter in Florida), and the meeting was held in the beautiful University of Florida campus, with a large lake (home to alligators, though none were spotted) and within easy walking distance of the lively Gainesville town centre.
